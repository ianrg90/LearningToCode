/*
Minimum
The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that returns its smallest argument. 
We can build something like that now. Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

/*
Recursion
We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to
see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

Zero is even.
One is odd.

For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single 
parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?
*/

function isEven (n){
    if(n > 1){
      return isEven(n-2)
    }
    if(n !== 0){
      return false
    }
    return true
  }

/*
Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many
uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that 
indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite 
countBs to make use of this new function.
*/

function countsB(str){
    let counter = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
      str[i] === 'B' ? counter++ : counter
    }
    return counter
  }
  
  function countChar(str, char){
    let counter = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
      str[i] === char ? counter++ : counter
    }
    return counter
